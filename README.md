<h1 align="center">PF2e Reputation Tracker</h1>

PF2e Reputation Tracker is a lightweight, simple reputation tracking system built for Foundry VTT's PF2e module. It uses AppV2 to generate the application windows, so compatibility is only assured on V13 at the moment.

_NOTE:_ There are currently no plans to add support for:
- Foundry V12
- DnD5e
- other systems

You are free to modify and redistribute (with attribution) version of this code that implements compatibility for these other systems and versions. The code is rudimentary, in places hacky, and far from optimal. I am not a skilled developer, this was me solving a problem for myself.
